    "- Formally known as ipython Notebook\n",
    "- Ipython started as GUI notebooks to run code\n",
    "- It had ipython kernel architecture written as well\n",
    "- Project Jupyter separated and branched out of ipython and decided that we will only work for (julia,python,R).\n",
    "    - But in the backend,jupyter project still uses the ipython's kernel\n",
    "- The Jupyter Notebook Application has three main kernels: the IPython, IRkernel and IJulia kernels.\n",
    "- These are kernels mantained by julyterlab(they take it from ipython in the backend)\n",
    "- The parallel computing network used to be part of the IPython project, but as of 4.0, they have removed it and made its separate standalone package called ipyparallel. \n",
    "- Itâ€™s so powerful because instead of running a single Python kernel, it allows you to start many distributed kernels over many machines\n",
    "- Everything you write in jupyter notebook is stored in RAM.\n",
    "    - Will be removed once you close the file"
