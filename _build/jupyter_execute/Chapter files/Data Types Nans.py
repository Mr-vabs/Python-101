# ## Missing Data Types

# - NaN means "Not a number"
#     - comes when wrong data type was placed in numeric types
#     - it is more like "numerically incorrect"

# - None means Python's none type
#     - "Empty or Not existed"

# - Nan and None are different data types but pandas consider them as same
