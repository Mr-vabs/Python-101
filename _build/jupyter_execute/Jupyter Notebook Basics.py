# ## Jupyter Notebook Basics

# - Formally known as ipython Notebook
# - Ipython started as GUI notebooks to run code
# - It had ipython kernel architecture written as well
# - Project Jupyter separated and branched out of ipython and decided that we will only work for (julia,python,R).
#     - But in the backend,jupyter project still uses the ipython's kernel
# - The Jupyter Notebook Application has three main kernels: the IPython, IRkernel and IJulia kernels.
# - These are kernels mantained by julyterlab(they take it from ipython in the backend)
# - The parallel computing network used to be part of the IPython project, but as of 4.0, they have removed it and made its separate standalone package called ipyparallel. 
# - Itâ€™s so powerful because instead of running a single Python kernel, it allows you to start many distributed kernels over many machines
# - Everything you write in jupyter notebook is stored in RAM.
#     - Will be removed once you close the file
