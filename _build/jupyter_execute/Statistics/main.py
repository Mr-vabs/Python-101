# ## Basic Probability

# ### Random Variables

# - In probability,we calculate the probablity(chances of outcomes)
# - We need to assign a number to each outcome
# - Function which does this is called random variable
# - For example,in below example :
#     - I clicked on any hexagon (click means outcome) and then gave it a number
#     - Repeated it for all the outcomes
#         - We now have random variable

# ### Variance

# - measure of distribution of random variable
# - The average value of the squared difference between the random variable and its expectation
#     - Var(X)=E[(Xâˆ’E[X])2]
