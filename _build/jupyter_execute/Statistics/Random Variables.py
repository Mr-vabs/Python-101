# ### Random Variables

# - In probability,we calculate the probablity(chances of outcomes)
# - We need to assign a number to each outcome
# - Function which does this is called random variable
# - For example,in below example :
#     - I clicked on any hexagon (click means outcome) and then gave it a number
#     - Repeated it for all the outcomes
#         - We now have random variable

# ### Types of Random Variable

# - Discrete Random Variable
#     - A discrete random variable has a finite/countable number of possible values.
# 
#     
# - Continuous Random Variable
#     - A continuous random variable has a infinite/non-countable number of possible values
