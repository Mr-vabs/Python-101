# ### Install vs Import

# - When you install something,all its files comes to your local(C drive) and you can access/import all the underlying libraries(files)
#     - eg,when we install python,by default you get pathlib library automatically
#     - So you just need to import it
#     - Note:These libraries which come auomatically when we install python and we don't need to install them separately,can import directly and start using them are called **Standard libraries**
#     
#     
# - But what if some library doesn't come by default when we install python?
#     - We will need to install that package manually
#     - Once it is installed,all the underlying libraries come to our local so now,we can import these libraries
#         - eg,smartsheet library(files) do not come by default when we install python
#         - So,we wil need to install smartsheet package manually
#         - Once we install this package,all its underlying files(libraries) will come to our local
#         - Now we can just use them by importing the one we need

# In local setups,you need to install only once and then anytime, you can import them in all other files
# 
# In cloud,you have to install and import everytime you open script
